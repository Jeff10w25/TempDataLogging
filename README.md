# Temperature Data Logging
This repository is part of Kasetsart University's senior project on 'Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) and Energy Piles,' which is divided into two parts: temperature data logging and control panel wiring design.

### Purpose
-To study the control and automation aspects of the electrical instruments used in GSHP and Energy Piles.
-To analyze the wiring diagram of electrical instruments in the GSHP control panel and create schematics using KiCAD. 

### Function
The Python script receives temperature data from digital indicators connected to a PT100 sensor via RS485 communication. Subsequently, this data is stored in an Excel file along with the corresponding time and date. The script is executed on a Raspberry Pi, enabling continuous temperature data logging.
