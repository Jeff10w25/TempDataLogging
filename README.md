# Temperature Data Logging
This repository is a part of Kasetsart University's senior project "Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) and Energy Piles".

## Purpose
To study the control and automation aspect of the electrical instruments that are being used in GSHP and Energy Piles. The program is being run on a Raspberry Pi, allowing continuous temperature data logging.

## Function
The Python script receives temperature data from digital indicators which are connected to a PT100 sensor through RS485 communication. Afterward, this data is stored in an Excel file with the time and date included.
